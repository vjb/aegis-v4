# CRE Skills

Assist developers working with the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) by looking up the latest documentation at runtime.

## Runtime Pattern

When a user asks a CRE-related question:

1. **Match user intent to a reference file** — Identify which topic best fits the query from the reference files listed below.
2. **Read the matching reference file** — Load `references/<file>.md` to find relevant URLs.
3. **Web-fetch 3-5 URLs** — Fetch the latest doc content from the URLs in the reference file. Prefer URLs whose one-line labels most closely match the user's question.
4. **Synthesize a response** — Answer using the fetched content. Cite source URLs so the user can read further.

Do NOT embed or rely on cached doc content. Always web-fetch to get the latest information.

## Reference Files

| File | Topic | When to use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [account-setup.md](references/account-setup.md) | Account setup | Creating accounts, CLI login, managing authentication |
| [getting-started.md](references/getting-started.md) | Getting started | CLI installation, project setup, tutorial walkthrough (Go & TypeScript) |
| [capabilities.md](references/capabilities.md) | Capabilities | EVM read/write, HTTP capability, triggers overview |
| [workflow-building.md](references/workflow-building.md) | Workflow building | Secrets, time, randomness, triggers (cron/HTTP/EVM log), HTTP client, EVM client, onchain read/write, report generation |
| [cli-reference.md](references/cli-reference.md) | CLI reference | CLI commands for accounts, auth, project setup, secrets, workflows, utilities |
| [sdk-reference.md](references/sdk-reference.md) | SDK reference | SDK core, consensus/aggregation, EVM client, HTTP client, trigger APIs (Go & TypeScript) |
| [operations.md](references/operations.md) | Operations | Deploying, simulating, monitoring, activating, pausing, updating, deleting workflows, multi-sig wallets |
| [concepts.md](references/concepts.md) | Concepts | Consensus computing, finality, non-determinism, TypeScript WASM runtime |
| [organization.md](references/organization.md) | Organization | Org management, inviting members, linking wallet keys |
| [general.md](references/general.md) | General | CRE overview, key terms, demos, templates, project configuration, supported networks, release notes, service quotas, support |

## Local SDK Reference

In addition to the web-fetched reference files above, a comprehensive **local SDK reference** is bundled in this skill directory:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [chainlink-cre-sdk-reference.txt](./chainlink-cre-sdk-reference.txt) | Complete CRE SDK reference including TypeScript/Go types, workflow patterns, capability APIs, consensus strategies, trigger schemas, and real-world examples. Read this file FIRST for any SDK, workflow, or capability question before web-fetching. |

## Project References (Aegis-Specific)

These docs capture battle-tested patterns and gotchas from building the Aegis Protocol CRE workflow:

| File | Topic | When to use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [CRE_SDK_AUDIT.md](../../../docs/CRE_SDK_AUDIT.md) | SDK compliance audit | Verifying `aegis-oracle.ts` follows CRE best practices — consensus, non-determinism, WASM, report writing |
| [CRE_BROADCAST_DEBUGGING.md](../../../docs/CRE_BROADCAST_DEBUGGING.md) | `IReceiver` broadcast fix | Debugging `writeReport()` silent failures — the `onReport(bytes,bytes)` + ERC165 fix |
| [CONFIDENTIAL_HTTP.md](../../../docs/CONFIDENTIAL_HTTP.md) | ConfidentialHTTPClient patterns | DON vs Node mode decisions, `vaultDonSecrets` injection, privacy architecture |
| [DEMO_SCENARIOS.md](../../../docs/DEMO_SCENARIOS.md) | Demo scenarios | Expected CRE outputs for BRETT (safe), honeypot (blocked), and budget wall scenarios |

## Tips

- **Always check `chainlink-cre-sdk-reference.txt` first** — it contains detailed SDK types, workflow patterns, and capability examples that are faster and more reliable than web-fetching.
- **Check Project References for Aegis-specific issues** — `CRE_BROADCAST_DEBUGGING.md` and `CRE_SDK_AUDIT.md` cover real gotchas encountered during development.
- Many topics have separate Go and TypeScript pages. Ask the user which language they're using if unclear, or fetch both.
- For workflow generation tasks, start with `workflow-building.md` and supplement with `sdk-reference.md` and `chainlink-cre-sdk-reference.txt` for API details.
- For onboarding, start with `getting-started.md` then `account-setup.md`.
- The full docs index is available at `assets/cre-docs-index.md` if you need to search across all URLs.
