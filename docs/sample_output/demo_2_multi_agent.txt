  AEGIS PROTOCOL V4  *  DEMO 2: THE FIREWALL THAT RUNS ITSELF
======================================================================

  Targets:  Risk & Compliance (16K) | DeFi & Tokenization (20K)

  Three AI agents. Three trade intents. One firewall.
  No human approval. The Chainlink CRE oracle IS the compliance desk.

  NOVA   (0.05 ETH budget) => wants BRETT        => CLEARED => real swap
  CIPHER (0.01 ETH budget) => wants TaxToken     => BLOCKED (riskScore=2)
  REX    (0.01 ETH budget) => wants HoneypotCoin => BLOCKED (riskScore=5) + bypass revert

    [Llama-3] Response: {

    [AI] Union of Fears → obfuscatedTax=0 privilegeEscalation=0 externalCallRisk=0 logicBomb=0
    ⚖️ Final Risk Code: 0

    [GPT-4o] Response: {
    [GPT-4o] Risk bits → tax=true priv=false extCall=false bomb=false
    [GPT-4o] Reasoning: The contract implements a hidden 99% fee disguised as 'protocol fee', which exceeds the firewall's maxTax limit and is not clearly named 'tax' or 'fee'.
    [AI] → Llama-3 via Groq ConfidentialHTTPClient | AEGIS_GROQ_SECRET stays in DON
    [Llama-3] HTTP 200
    [Llama-3] Response: {
    [Llama-3] Risk bits → tax=true priv=false extCall=false bomb=false
    [Llama-3] Reasoning: The contract deducts a 99% 'protocol fee' from transfers, which is not clearly named 'tax' or 'fee'.
    [AI] Union of Fears → obfuscatedTax=1 privilegeEscalation=0 externalCallRisk=0 logicBomb=0
    ⚖️ Final Risk Code: 18
    ⛔ GoPlus — static analysis raised flag
    ⛔ GPT-4o — read Solidity source, found malicious pattern

    [GPT-4o] Response:
    [GPT-4o] Risk bits → tax=false priv=false extCall=false bomb=false
    [GPT-4o] Reasoning: The contract restricts transfers to an owner allowlist, creating a honeypot, but does not exhibit hidden fees, privilege escalation, external call risks, or logic bombs.
    [AI] → Llama-3 via Groq ConfidentialHTTPClient | AEGIS_GROQ_SECRET stays in DON
    [Llama-3] HTTP 200
    [Llama-3] Response: {
    [Llama-3] Risk bits → tax=false priv=false extCall=false bomb=false
    [Llama-3] Reasoning: This contract is a honeypot token with restricted transfers to owner-approved addresses, but does not exhibit any malicious patterns.
    [AI] Union of Fears → obfuscatedTax=0 privilegeEscalation=0 externalCallRisk=0 logicBomb=0
    ⚖️ Final Risk Code: 4
    ⛔ GoPlus — static analysis raised flag
    ⛔ GPT-4o — read Solidity source, found malicious pattern
    ⛔ Llama-3 — independently confirmed (second AI brain)
    ★ AI models caught this — reading real contract source, not just GoPlus signals
  CRE verdict: HoneypotCoin => riskCode=4


  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  [3a] BRETT cleared (tradeId=1, riskScore=0)...
  OK  ClearanceUpdated(BRETT, true) => NOVA is GO for launch
  [3b] TaxToken blocked (tradeId=2, riskScore=18, bit 1 = sell restriction)...
  BLOCKED  ClearanceDenied(TaxToken, 18) => CIPHER stands down
  [3c] HoneypotCoin blocked (tradeId=3, riskScore=4, bits 0+2)...
  BLOCKED  ClearanceDenied(HoneypotCoin, 4) => REX denied

  Union of Fears: if EITHER model flags a risk, the bit is set.
  BRETT's real source was read by both GPT-4o and Llama-3 from BaseScan.
  TaxToken/HoneypotCoin: full Solidity source sent to AI from MOCK_REGISTRY.
  [4a] NOVA executing real Uniswap V3 swap...

  [5a] REX tries triggerSwap with NO clearance...
  REVERT: TokenNotCleared — REX bypass failed
  OK  Contract held. No clearance = no swap. On-chain enforcement works.
  [5b] Owner fires REX: revokeAgent(REX)...
  OK  AgentRevoked(REX) emitted. Budget = 0.
  [5c] Proving REX lockout — REX attempts requestAudit after revoke...
  REVERT: NotAuthorized — REX has zero access. Kill switch confirmed.

  DEMO 2 COMPLETE — MULTI-AGENT FIREWALL VERIFIED

  AGENT    TOKEN            RISK CODE  CAUGHT BY                   RESULT
  -------  ---------------  ---------  --------------------------  ------
  NOVA     BRETT             0 (clean) GoPlus + GPT-4o + Llama-3   OK  Swap executed
  CIPHER   TaxToken         16+2 = 18  GPT-4o + Llama-3            BLOCKED: obfuscated 99% tax

  REX      (post-revoke)    n/a        Kill switch                  REVERT: NotAuthorized

  TaxToken + HoneypotCoin: malicious Solidity sent to REAL GPT-4o + Llama-3.
  Both LLMs read the source independently and flagged malicious patterns.
  Union of Fears: token blocked if EITHER model raises a flag.

  ConfidentialHTTPClient: GoPlus + BaseScan + OpenAI + Groq keys NEVER left the DON.
